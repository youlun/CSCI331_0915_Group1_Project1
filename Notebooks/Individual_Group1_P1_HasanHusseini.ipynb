Anyways, some of the execs had a moment of genius and realized that the best way to track this is by seeing where the money and products move in the database.

They're a fresh hire, and databases do provide a lot of info, but without any hard evidence from actually investigating things on-site, it's not really possible to prove anyone did something. It's also my first thing writing anything like this - anything else I've written out of pure creativity has really just not been about any form of mystery/investigative work or modern concepts like databases and companies.
